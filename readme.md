A web crawler for pictures based on MFC and VS2012.

Simple and scalable. Can be used to batch download the pictures on a website. Can also be configged to download other elements on a page, or filter keywords in URLs.

The UI is in English, but there is a few Chinese in the comments of the codes. There is also an [Chinese introduction](http://blog.csdn.net/viggin/article/details/4546900) of the program.
